# Megaboard Perl
Configurable message board written in Perl 5, circa 2001 (archive)

### OLD CODE WARNING! :)

This is an archive of my original message board script.  It is written in procedural Perl 5 and stores data in tab-delimitted flat-files.  It supports multiple main forums, subforums grouped by category, threads, user registration, adminstration, and rudimentary HTML customization.

It is rough by today's standards and extremely insecure, but now it will live forever on Github!
